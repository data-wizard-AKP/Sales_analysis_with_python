 ## Key Objectives

-Customer Behavior Analysis
• Analyzed how demographic factors such as age, gender, and marital status influence product category preferences in purchasing behavior.
• Evaluated the impact of occupation on purchasing behavior, identifying that most buyers work in the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.

-Predictive Modeling
• Built a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase products from key categories such as Food, Clothing, or Electronics based on their demographic and occupational data.
• Analyzed variable importance to identify the top influencing factors.

-Customer Segmentation
• Grouped customers by similar profiles and age group for targeted marketing.
• Used clusters to identify high-potential segments for campaign targeting.

-Business Insights
• Recommended strategies for personalized offers and better engagement.
• Identified key factors such as Gender, Age Group, and occupation that impact buying decisions.

-Tools Used
• Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation; NumPy – for numerical operations; Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data analysis and visualizations.

# This project demonstrates how customer data can be leveraged to drive data-backed decisions in retail and marketing environments.
